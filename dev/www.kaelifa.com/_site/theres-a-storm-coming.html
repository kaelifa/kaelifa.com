<p>Right now, I feel like I&#8217;m looking into a crystal ball and I can see into the future. I can see very clearly and what I see scares me, it should scare you too.</p>

<p>Kids who have grown up not knowing a time without the Internet, are not getting enough (if any) education about how to manage their online profile, we need to change this and we need to change it fast.</p>

<p>When these kids start applying for jobs and universities (and it&#8217;s already started happening) employers and universities are Googling them, and so many of the results contain variations of &#8220;#FML I hate XYZ&#8221;, the kids are being judged on this and the scary thing is they don&#8217;t even know or understand it&#8217;s happening. Potentially doors are being closed based purely on their &#8216;online social presence&#8217;.</p>

<p>The kids are not aware of the effect that what they&#8217;re writing now, is going to have on their futures. They are the next generation, they contain our future Prime Ministers, Presidents, Doctors and Scientists - even if they don&#8217;t know it yet. We cannot afford to lose them simply because of something they tweeted when they were kids.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t agree that employers should search Facebook to find out about people, this is no different to an employer spying on someone on a night out with friends in a pub. How we encourage employers to stop doing that will have to wait for another post.</p>

<p>However, anything that is posted in a &#8216;public&#8217; forum, i.e. Twitter, Flickr, Vimeo, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, and so on, that is different. These are tools that people need to be taught how to use. Or at least, they need to understand that anything they post on these websites can be found and they will all build an online picture of someone.</p>

<p>When I was at school, it was drummed into us that the grades we achieved would impact on our futures (even if we didn&#8217;t care about it at the time). For kids in school right now, it&#8217;s not only grades they need to worry about, it&#8217;s everything they do online.</p>

<p>People are also being judged for &#8216;not&#8217; having any kind of online presence. So, potentially, a &#8216;lack&#8217; of web presence will also affect them. This is unfair, but it&#8217;s what &#8216;is&#8217; happening. We need to recognise that it is happening to be able to do anything about it. If it comes down to selecting between someone who has blogged passionately about something and someone who has no online presence, the blogger is going to win.</p>

<p>The kids that are in school right now don&#8217;t know of a time without the Internet, and as a result they are less concerned about their online privacy. This is both very good and very bad in equal measures.</p>

<p>Its up to us to educate them, or we&#8217;re going to end up in the situation where no one will employ these kids due to the fact that they didn&#8217;t take their futures seriously enough at the age of 13.</p>

<h2 id='what_do_we_do_about_it'>What do we do about it?</h2>

<p>We talk, we listen and we educate, not only the kids, but also the schools and parents, in fact anyone who wants to listen. We need to nag schools and government to get this added onto curriculums. Learning how to manage ourselves online is going to be an essential skill. This also means we need to help educate the educators, as they need to be more aware of what it means to be &#8216;online&#8217;.</p>

<p>We can no longer assume that the only things a prospective employer will know about us (before ever meeting us) are gleaned from the CV we have so carefully prepared for them. One or two tweets complaining about what I&#8217;m doing or a couple of pictures from a night out, will destroy all of the first impressions that I wanted someone to have of me before meeting me. It won&#8217;t matter how smartly I present myself, if the photos that the employer found were of me in fancy dress with what appears to be a gun in my hand. After seeing those, I probably wouldn&#8217;t even get an interview.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas about what to do about this, because I truly think we can make a difference but we need to work together to achieve it. We need to talk to anyone that will listen and show them how to build a positive online presence. Show them how to make choices that are true representations of their real life characters.</p>

<p>After all, we all have one, even if we&#8217;ve worked hard to not have one. That is still a presence.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying, we should lie. What I&#8217;m saying is, &#8220;Look at your Twitter feed, read what you&#8217;ve posted and read it as if you&#8217;re someone else&#8221;. Is the overall feeling one of positivity or are the tweets collectively conveying a picture of negativity?</p>

<p>Oh, and avoid text speak. Save that for texting and Facebook.</p>
